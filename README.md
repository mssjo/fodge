# FODGE
FODGE: Flavour-Ordered Diagram Generator

Generates flavour-ordered diagrams in the NLSM.
Used in my master's thesis and in an upcoming article -
soon to be found in an arXiv close to you!

NOTE: The version used in my 2019 master's thesis 
(Lund University LU TP 19-21)
is now deprecated, and has been moved to the old/
directory. (It never worked very well, so good riddance.)
