# FODGE
FODGE: Flavour-Ordered Diagram Generator

Generates flavour-ordered diagrams in the NLSM.
Old version used in my master's thesis, new version
used in upcoming article arXiv:1909.XXXXX by 
J. Bijnens, K. Kampf and me. Inspired by earlier work 
by J. Bijnens.

To install, place all files and directories
in a directory of your choice, and run "cmake ."
followed by "make fodge". Run "doxygen Doxyfile" to generate 
documentation.

FODGE runs in the command line. Run "fodge -h" to print
a useful help message detailing the usage.

FODGE interoperates with FORM; 
see https://www.nikhef.nl/~form/.
It also interoperates with TikZ under LaTeX; 
see e.g. https://www.latex-project.org/.

NOTE: The version used in my 2019 master's thesis 
(Lund University LU TP 19-21)
is now deprecated, and has been removed from this repository.
If you want to access it, just tell me.
(It never worked very well, so good riddance.)
